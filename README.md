# React/Redux Chat-Project

A react/redux based chat project I wrote to learn more about these frameworks. Initially I wanted to try implementing e2ee but I realised that wouldn't be possible from a browser so I just made each room individually password-protected. Could still possibly implement e2ee if I used Electron.

# Usage

1. run `npm install && node server.js` from /backend
2. run `npm install && npm start` from /frontend
3. navigate to `localhost:3000`
