in home.js, need to change socket.emit to a post request

then handle that in backend

if password is correct join the user (socket)

or if the user is already in a room just redirect them to room page

when user leaves room (leave room button) remove the jwt

todo: add authentication

add css tooltips on homepage

auth -> check roomname + password then issue jwt

then redirect to chat page

emit joinroom with jwt

check jwt is valid

if yes -> subscribe

if no -> socket.emit error message
